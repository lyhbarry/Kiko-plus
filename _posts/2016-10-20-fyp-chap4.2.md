# More Modules
For part II, we will look at submodules and functors, and the manipulation of modules; which will also be of reference to this [OCaml tutorial](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/modules.html).

## Submodules
A submodule is a module that is defined explicitly from within another modules. 

### Implementation
The following example shows how submodules are defined:

```ocaml
module Hello = struct
  let message = "Hello"
  let hello () = print_endline message
end
let goodbye () = print_endline "Goodbye"
let hello_goodbye () =
  Hello.hello ();
  goodbye ()
```

To access the submodule <b>Hello</b>, we will do the following:

```ocaml
let () = 
	Example.Hello.hello ();
```

### Interface
To restrict the interface of a submodule, we can do the following:

```ocaml
module Hello : sig
 val hello : unit -> unit
end = 
struct
  let message = "Hello"
  let hello () = print_endline message
end
  
(* At this point, Hello.message is not accessible anymore. *)
let goodbye () = print_endline "Goodbye"
let hello_goodbye () =
  Hello.hello ();
  goodbye ()
```

The method described above is not the best way to do it as we can do the following to make our code cleaner:

```ocaml
module type Hello_type = sig
 val hello : unit -> unit
end
  
module Hello : Hello_type = struct
  ...
end
```

In the next section, we will look at how submodules will complement the implementation of functors.

## Functors
As defined by the tutorial, functors are modules that are parametrized by other module. Although, they mentioned that we may never have to define a functor ourselves to be a proficient OCaml programmer, however I feel that functors will be essential for building our libraries for this particular project. 

One thing to note is that functors are made to aid programmers in writing correct programs, not to write better performing programs.

Let us now see functors in action. In order to restrict the manipulation of `Set` to strings, we will make use of the `Make` functor provided in `Set` in the following code:

```ocaml
# module String_set = Set.Make (String);;
module String_set :
  sig
    type elt = String.t
    type t = Set.Make(String).t
    val empty : t
    val is_empty : t -> bool
    val mem : elt -> t -> bool
    val add : elt -> t -> t
    val singleton : elt -> t
    val remove : elt -> t -> t
    val union : t -> t -> t
    val inter : t -> t -> t
    val diff : t -> t -> t
    val compare : t -> t -> int
    val equal : t -> t -> bool
    val subset : t -> t -> bool
    val iter : (elt -> unit) -> t -> unit
    val fold : (elt -> 'a -> 'a) -> t -> 'a -> 'a
    val for_all : (elt -> bool) -> t -> bool
    val exists : (elt -> bool) -> t -> bool
    val filter : (elt -> bool) -> t -> t
    val partition : (elt -> bool) -> t -> t * t
    val cardinal : t -> int
    val elements : t -> elt list
    val min_elt : t -> elt
    val max_elt : t -> elt
    val choose : t -> elt
    val split : elt -> t -> t * bool * t
    val find : elt -> t -> elt
    val of_list : elt list -> t
  end
``` 

How do we then define a functor? To define a functor we will do the following:

```ocaml
module F (X : X_type) = struct
	...
end	
```

In the code above, `X` is the module that will be passed as an argument and `X_type` is the signature (It's a must-have).

To constrain the signature of the returned module in-file, we can do the following:

```ocaml
module F (X : X_type) : Y_type = 
struct
	...
end
```

or doing it in a .mli file:

```ocaml
module F (X : X_type) : Y_type
```	

## Manipulation of Modules
To look into the contents of a module such as `List` in `utop` (an OCaml toplevel that I'm using), we can do the following:

```ocaml
# module M = List;;
module M = List
```

Also, to include a functions that we need into a standard module we can build an `extensions.ml` file and using the `include` directives as follows:

```ocaml
# module List = struct
    include List
    let rec optmap f = function
      | [] -> []
      | hd :: tl ->
         match f hd with
         | None -> optmap f tl
         | Some x -> x :: optmap f tl
  end;;
```

In order for us to override the standard `List` module, we will include the following at the start of our file:

```ocaml
open Extensions
...
List.optmap ...
```

## Now We Here
Now that we have some basic understanding of OCaml modules, we can then proceed to building some basic modules for some of the more general features that we have built previously with lablgtk; which will be covered in future posts. By putting what we have learnt about modules into practical uses, it will help us to have a better grasp of this project as a whole.
