# Counter and Buttons
After going through the basics of Ocaml with <i>lablgtk</i>, let us now take a look at the following example of a counter using the buttons widget in <i>lablgtk</i> that I have built:

```ocaml
open GMain
open GdkKeysyms

let locale = GtkMain.Main.init ()

let count = ref 0

let main () =
  let window = GWindow.window ~width:320 ~height:240
                              ~title:"Simple lablgtk program" () in
  let vbox = GPack.vbox ~packing:window#add () in
  window#connect#destroy ~callback:Main.quit;

  (* Menu bar *)
  let menubar = GMenu.menu_bar ~packing:vbox#pack () in
  let factory = new GMenu.factory menubar in
  let accel_group = factory#accel_group in
  let file_menu = factory#add_submenu "File" in

  (* File menu *)
  let factory = new GMenu.factory file_menu ~accel_group in
  factory#add_item "Quit" ~key:_Q ~callback: Main.quit;

  (* Button *)
  let add_button = GButton.button ~label:"+"
                              ~packing:vbox#add () in
  add_button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> count := !count + 1; prerr_endline (string_of_int(!count)));

  let minus_button = GButton.button ~label:"-"
                              ~packing:vbox#add () in 
  minus_button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> count := !count - 1; prerr_endline (string_of_int(!count)));

  (* Display the windows and enter Gtk+ main loop *)
  window#add_accel_group accel_group;
  window#show ();
  Main.main ()

let () = main ()
```

This <i>counter</i> example is built upon the <i>simple.ml</i> tutorial example covered in the [previous](https://lyhbarry.github.io/2016-10-04/fyp-chap3.1/) post. In this example, I wish to demonstrate the implementation of some basic functionalities with button widgets. 

For now, let us look at the following two blocks of code which are the core to this <i>counter</i> example:

```ocaml
let count = ref 0
```

Right here, in order to implement the counter, I have made use of OCaml <i>Refs</i>. This may not be the ideal way to do this, however it still serves quite well as a stepping stone to better understanding the mechanics of building applications with <b>OCaml</b> and <b>lablgtk</b>.

```ocaml
(* Button *)
let add_button = GButton.button ~label:"+"
                          ~packing:vbox#add () in
add_button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> count := !count + 1; prerr_endline (string_of_int(!count)));

let minus_button = GButton.button ~label:"-"
                          ~packing:vbox#add () in 
minus_button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> count := !count - 1; prerr_endline (string_of_int(!count)));
```

In the code above, we are creating two buttons for adding and substracting to the counter. For the callback of each button upon receiving a <i>clicked</i> signal, we will update the count with respect to whichever button that has been clicked. Another thing to note is that we are printing the value of the counter onto the terminal instead of displaying it on the application window. Fret not, as we will look at how we can further improve upon this example in the [next](#) post. 

Right below, we can see how our counter application looks like and observe how the value of the counter is being printed in the terminal with each successive clicks:

## Means To An End 
In short, we can view this example as a means to an end to achieving the end result we hope to achieve at the end of this project. All this may not seem very Elm-like, neither does it replicates the MVC model well. Nevertheless, we are another step closer to building a web-based UI with OCaml.
